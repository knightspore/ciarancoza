                I'm a full-stack software engineer and musician from Cape Town ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦.
                I love the South African countryside and I'm fascinated by learning about art, computers, history and
                people. I've worked as a <Link href="/projects">software engineer</Link> for
                the past few years, and I've been <Link href="/art">making music</Link> a few
                years longer.
